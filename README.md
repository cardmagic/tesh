# tesh

A highly dynamic shell environment/programming language with data structures

## Installation

```console
$ crystal build
$ mv tesh /usr/local/bin
$ tesh
```

## Usage

Tesh is built to look and feel like bash almost all the time.

```console
$ echo hello world
hello world
```
But then add various programming primitives that engineers expect.

```console
$ echo 1 + 2
3
```
